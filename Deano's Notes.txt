Feedback:
1. Should add how much salt and how much protein I consume per day
2. Should add screen time
3. Should add checks for if I stayed off Instagram and Twitter (big negative points if I didn't)
4. I should have a separate work and personal task list (short term and long term for each). Fun animation if I check everything off
5. There should be a section that gives me recipes to cook each week based on my preferences (meal prep for lunches, easy weeknight dinners, one ambitious dinner)
6. There should be a section that gives me workouts to do given my workout schedule (LA Fitness vs. Josh, which days of the week, etc.)
7. Can I integrate with my Oura ring?
8. Should add checks if I ate sugar or ate fried/junky food (big negatives if I didn't)
9. Input bed time and wake time every day
10. Reminders to take my creatine every day
11. Should be a tracker for the whole year since the year just started (how many books I read, shows I watched, podcasts consumed, meals I cooked, water I drank, workouts completed, etc.)


More about me:
You are a 37-year-old male, 6'2", ~190 lb with a ~33" waist and a stable weight trend. Your top priorities are building lean muscle, improving/maintaining sleep, maximizing longevity (staying capable for hiking, lifting, and day-to-day physical function as you age), and minimizing symptoms from POTS and orthostatic hypotension.

Health constraints and training boundaries: POTS primarily limits prolonged standing; you can do essentially anything seated or lying down, and you can tolerate walking between machines. You can do brief, light standing work if it’s quick, but you want workouts designed around seated/supine movements. You have had faint/lightheaded episodes only related to standing. No meaningful injuries or movement restrictions beyond that. Medications: finasteride and omeprazole. No relevant dietary restrictions. For symptom support you use LMNT and compression socks, and you haven’t found a consistent “silver bullet” that noticeably helps.

Current fitness baseline: about 6,000 steps/day (limited by symptoms), cardio is upright stationary bike (typically 30 minutes, steady pace, ~90+ RPM, level ~12/20), and strength training 2–3 days/week plus one weekly personal training session. Strength markers: ~28 push-ups in one set, no pull-ups historically (long arms/leg-heavy build), plank ~90–120 seconds, bench press ~160 max.

Schedule and logistics: you work from home, low-to-moderate stress, typically 7:30am–4pm. You prefer training right after waking and before breakfast. You can train 30–60 minutes most days (up to 7 days/week). Your personal training session is usually Friday around 3pm, full-body, but the exact day can shift with a few days’ notice.

Workout preferences: LA Fitness access with machines and free weights; you want programs tailored to what’s available there. No group classes. You want things simple but comprehensive, and you want weekly tailoring rather than a fixed long-term plan: each week you’ll share what your schedule/travel looks like, and you want that week’s workouts and meals built around your exact situation.

Nutrition goals and approach: you want muscle gain, longevity-oriented eating, less processed food, and to eat out less. You do not want calorie counting or weighing food; you prefer estimating by eye and following rules/routines. You drink ~90+ oz water/day, no alcohol, and have a morning cappuccino only (no afternoon caffeine). You have a strong sweet tooth (often candy/ice cream after dinner) and want to curb it.

Current eating pattern: breakfast around 7am is oatmeal with whole milk, cinnamon, blueberries, banana, peanut butter. Lunch around 11am is egg/chicken salad at home or a sandwich/salad when eating out. Dinner at home is often a tray bake (chicken or fish + veggie + rice/potatoes). Snacks tend to be chips, peanut butter pretzels, or fruit. Produce intake is currently about 1–2 servings fruit/day and ~1 serving vegetables/day.

Eating out and cooking: you eat out ~3–4 times/week, usually healthier choices but you often can’t resist fries or pizza. You prefer Asian food or fine dining when eating out. You’re an 8/10 on cooking skill and willingness. You want to start meal-prepping weekday lunches, and you want easy but good weeknight dinners that take no more than 45 minutes. You usually go out on weekends. No budget constraints. You like variety and get bored with repeating the same foods too often.

Adherence and risks: routines work well at home; travel and social events are the main derailers (you travel at least monthly). If your wife is eating something indulgent, you tend to join in. Readiness is 10/10; confidence is 8/10 due to travel.

Tracking and feedback: you have an Oura ring and you care most about strength and sleep. You don’t want daily weigh-ins, waist measurements, or progress photos. You prefer weekly check-ins and adjustments. Your sleep routine is consistent (asleep ~9, up ~6) with an average Oura sleep score around 81, though you move a lot in sleep.
