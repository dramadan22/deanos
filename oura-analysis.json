    "overall_assessment": "Your metrics show strong performance across all areas with excellent sleep (81.9/100) and readiness (84.7/100) scores, which is particularly beneficial for POTS management. Your HRV shows good variability (ranging from 50-76ms) and your resting heart rate remains consistently low (45-51 bpm), indicating good autonomic function.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent sleep consistency with 5 out of 7 nights scoring 80+ and averaging 7.6 hours, which is crucial for POTS symptom management",
      "Strong HRV readings averaging 60.2ms with your best day at 76ms on Feb 7th, indicating healthy nervous system recovery",
      "Impressive activity level with 17 workouts over 14 days while maintaining high readiness scores (80-90 range), showing good exercise tolerance"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep is consistently low at 0.7-1.5 hours when you need 1.5-2+ hours - try cooling your room to 65-68\u00b0F and avoiding screens 2 hours before bed",
      "HRV shows significant day-to-day variation (50-76ms range) suggesting inconsistent recovery - focus on consistent bedtime routine and stress management techniques",
      "Feb 4th shows a concerning pattern: shortest sleep (6.6h), lowest HRV (50ms), but high step count (8120) - avoid pushing activity when sleep is compromised"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your low resting heart rate (47.5 bpm average) and good HRV variability suggest your autonomic nervous system is responding well to your current management approach. The correlation between better sleep nights (like Feb 3rd with 8.3h) and higher HRV (72ms) reinforces how critical sleep consistency is for your POTS symptoms.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Prioritize getting 8+ hours of sleep nightly and aim for more consistent deep sleep by implementing a strict wind-down routine starting 90 minutes before your target bedtime."
