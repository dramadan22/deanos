    "overall_assessment": "Your metrics show strong overall health management with excellent readiness scores averaging 86.1/100 and good sleep quality at 82.8/100. The high activity level with 18 workouts over 14 days demonstrates impressive engagement, though some variability in recovery patterns suggests room for optimization.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent readiness scores consistently above 80, with peak scores of 93 on Feb 10th and 90 on Feb 8th, indicating strong recovery capacity",
      "Strong HRV readings averaging 63.8ms with several days showing 68-76ms, suggesting good autonomic nervous system regulation despite POTS",
      "Consistent sleep duration averaging 7.6 hours with good efficiency at 85.4%, providing the stable sleep foundation crucial for POTS management"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep shows concerning variability (0.7-1.6 hours) with particularly low amounts on Feb 10th (0.8h) and Feb 7th (0.7h) - aim for consistent pre-sleep routines and cooler room temperature",
      "REM sleep averaging only 1.5 hours appears low for your sleep duration - consider reducing caffeine after 2pm and maintaining consistent sleep/wake times",
      "HRV dropped notably to 55ms on Feb 8th compared to your typical 68-76ms range - monitor stress levels and consider gentle recovery activities on lower HRV days"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your relatively low resting heart rate averaging 47.4 bpm combined with strong HRV suggests good cardiovascular conditioning, which is beneficial for POTS symptom management. The consistent readiness scores above 80 indicate your autonomic nervous system is responding well to your current activity and recovery balance.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Prioritize deep sleep consistency by establishing a wind-down routine 1 hour before bed and keeping your bedroom temperature between 65-68\u00b0F, as stable deep sleep is crucial for autonomic nervous system regulation in POTS."
