    "overall_assessment": "Your metrics show generally good consistency with a 79.3 sleep score average and healthy HRV at 55.5ms, but there's a concerning decline on January 19th with sleep dropping to 66/100 and readiness plummeting to 37. The significant spike in resting heart rate to 68 bpm on that day (compared to your typical 45-50 bpm range) suggests your autonomic system may be under stress.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent HRV consistency averaging 55.5ms with strong readings like 69ms on Jan 15th and 66ms on Jan 13th, indicating good autonomic nervous system recovery",
      "Strong activity levels with 15 workouts over 14 days and good daily step counts (9,446 steps on Jan 17th), showing you're maintaining fitness without overexertion",
      "Solid sleep efficiency at 77.5% average with good duration most nights (7.5+ hours on Jan 15th, 16th, and 17th)"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep is concerning at only 1.2 hours average, with some nights as low as 0.6 hours (Jan 18th) - aim for 7-9 hours total sleep and consider sleep hygiene improvements",
      "The dramatic drop on Jan 19th (readiness 37, RHR 68, sleep 66) suggests a recovery issue - identify potential triggers like stress, dehydration, or overexertion from previous days",
      "Sleep consistency needs attention as scores vary widely from 66-88, which can significantly impact POTS symptom management and autonomic stability"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your elevated resting heart rate on Jan 19th (68 bpm vs typical 45-50 bpm) combined with poor readiness suggests a potential POTS flare or autonomic dysfunction episode. The generally good HRV readings indicate your nervous system is responding well to your current management approach most days.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Prioritize sleep consistency by maintaining a strict 7.5+ hour sleep schedule and identifying what triggered the Jan 19th decline to prevent future autonomic system stress episodes"
