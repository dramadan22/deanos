However, there's notable HRV variability (ranging from 49-66ms in recent days) and some inconsistent sleep duration patterns that warrant attention for POTS management.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent sleep efficiency at 80.2% average, showing you're spending quality time in restorative sleep phases",
      "Strong activity consistency with 16 workouts over 14 days and an impressive 85.8/100 activity score, demonstrating good cardiovascular conditioning",
      "Your resting heart rate averaging 49.2 bpm is exceptionally low and stable (48-57 range), suggesting good autonomic control"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep duration averaging only 1.2 hours is below optimal - aim for 1.5-2 hours by establishing a cooler bedroom temperature (65-68\u00b0F) and consistent bedtime routine",
      "HRV shows significant day-to-day variation (49-66ms range), suggesting stress or recovery inconsistency - implement daily stress management techniques like gentle yoga or meditation",
      "Sleep duration inconsistency (6.7h to 7.8h recently) may be affecting autonomic stability - prioritize a consistent 8-hour sleep window nightly"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your low, stable resting heart rate and good HRV average (55.5ms) suggest your autonomic nervous system is responding well to your current management approach. The HRV variability pattern aligns with POTS recovery cycles, where consistency in sleep and gradual activity building are crucial for symptom management.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Establish a fixed bedtime routine to achieve consistent 8-hour sleep windows, as the recent sleep duration variability may be contributing to your HRV fluctuations and could impact POTS symptom stability."
