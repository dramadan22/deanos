    "overall_assessment": "Your health metrics show strong performance across all areas with particularly impressive sleep (81.9/100) and readiness (84.4/100) scores. The 21 workouts completed in 14 days demonstrates excellent activity consistency, though some variability in deep sleep and HRV patterns warrant attention for optimal POTS management.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent sleep efficiency at 84.8% with consistently good sleep scores (80-87 range in recent days) supporting stable autonomic function",
      "Strong HRV average of 62.2 ms with good daily readings (53-69 range) indicating healthy nervous system recovery capacity",
      "Outstanding activity consistency with 21 workouts in 14 days and solid readiness scores (78-89 range) showing good recovery between sessions"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep shows high variability (0.7-1.8 hours) - aim for more consistent 7+ hour sleep windows and optimize sleep environment for better deep sleep consistency",
      "HRV dropped to 53 ms on Feb 18th coinciding with lower readiness (78) - monitor for overtraining and ensure adequate recovery days between intense activities",
      "Large step count variations (3088-11206 steps) suggest inconsistent activity pacing - aim for more steady daily movement to avoid autonomic system stress"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your resting heart rate averaging 47.9 bpm with good HRV suggests well-managed POTS symptoms, but the variable deep sleep patterns could impact autonomic stability. The consistent high activity scores indicate you're successfully balancing exercise tolerance without triggering symptom flares.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Prioritize consistent 7+ hour sleep windows and aim for more even daily step counts (6000-8000 range) to support autonomic nervous system stability and maintain your excellent recovery metrics."
