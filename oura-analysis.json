    "overall_assessment": "Your metrics show generally good health management with an average sleep score of 80.1 and strong activity levels (85.1 average score with 12 workouts).

    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent activity consistency with 12 workouts over 14 days and strong activity scores (91 on Jan 17, 86 on Jan 16, 82 on Jan 15)",
      "Your HRV shows good recovery capacity with some strong readings like 69 ms on Jan 15 and your average of 54.8 ms indicates decent autonomic function",
      "Sleep duration is consistently good at 7.4 hours average, with some nights showing quality deep sleep like 1.6h on Jan 20"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Address deep sleep inconsistency - you had only 0.3h on Jan 19 compared to 1.6h on Jan 20, suggesting sleep environment or routine needs stabilization",
      "Monitor the connection between poor sleep and elevated heart rate - your RHR jumped to 57 bpm on Jan 19 when sleep quality dropped, indicating autonomic stress",
      "Investigate what caused the Jan 19 crash (readiness 37, HRV 43, steps only 725) to identify and avoid similar triggers"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "The dramatic variability in your metrics, especially the Jan 19 episode with elevated RHR (57 vs 46-50 typical) and crashed readiness, suggests your autonomic nervous system is still quite reactive to stressors. Your generally good HRV average of 54.8 ms is encouraging for POTS management, but the fluctuations indicate you need consistent sleep and recovery protocols.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Prioritize sleep consistency by maintaining the same bedtime routine that gave you 1.6h deep sleep on Jan 20, and identify what environmental or lifestyle factors contributed to the Jan 19 autonomic disruption"
