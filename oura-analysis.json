The 24-point swing in sleep scores (67 to 91) and inconsistent deep sleep (0.3h to 1.2h) could be impacting your POTS management.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Your HRV is showing healthy variation (53-63ms range) with strong peaks on Jan 26th and 30th (62-63ms), indicating good autonomic nervous system recovery",
      "Activity levels are excellent at 89.1 average with 12 workouts completed, showing you're maintaining good physical conditioning without overdoing it",
      "Your resting heart rate remains consistently low (45-54 bpm range) which is positive for cardiovascular health with POTS"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep is critically low averaging only 1.0 hour - aim for 1.5-2+ hours by establishing a consistent bedtime routine and optimizing sleep environment",
      "Sleep efficiency at 81.4% needs improvement - work on reducing time awake in bed through better sleep hygiene and stress management",
      "The dramatic sleep score drop on Jan 28th (67/100 with only 0.3h deep sleep) suggests identifying and avoiding triggers that disrupt sleep architecture"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your HRV patterns correlate well with your better sleep nights (63ms HRV on Jan 26th with 91 sleep score), confirming that quality sleep is crucial for your autonomic function. The consistent low resting heart rate is encouraging for POTS management.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Prioritize achieving 1.5+ hours of deep sleep nightly by going to bed 30 minutes earlier and implementing a wind-down routine to support autonomic nervous system recovery"
