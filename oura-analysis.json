However, there's concerning variability in your HRV (ranging from 49-69ms) and some data gaps on 1/18 that suggest potential autonomic fluctuations.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent sleep duration consistency averaging 7.5 hours with good efficiency at 82.5%, which is crucial for POTS autonomic stability",
      "Strong activity levels with 16 workouts over 14 days and average 6,519 steps, showing you're maintaining fitness without overexertion",
      "Good overall readiness scores averaging 82.4/100, indicating your body is generally recovering well between activities"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep is consistently low at 1.0-1.3 hours (should target 1.5-2 hours) - try cooling your sleep environment and avoiding screens 2 hours before bed",
      "HRV shows significant day-to-day swings (49-69ms range), suggesting autonomic instability - focus on consistent sleep/wake times and stress management techniques",
      "Data gaps on 1/18 combined with elevated resting heart rate (55 vs your 48.7 average) suggest you may have pushed too hard - prioritize recovery days after high activity periods"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your HRV variability (20-point swings) and elevated RHR on 1/18 are red flags for POTS flare-ups, as autonomic nervous system instability often manifests this way before symptoms worsen. The correlation between your highest activity day (1/17: 9,446 steps) and next-day data issues suggests you may be hitting your activity threshold.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Establish a consistent bedtime routine to improve deep sleep percentage and implement daily HRV tracking as an early warning system - if HRV drops below 50ms, prioritize gentle movement and extra hydration that day."
