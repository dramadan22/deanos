Your resting heart rate of 49 bpm is well-controlled, though your HRV shows some variability (ranging from 50-63 ms) that warrants attention for optimal POTS management.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Sleep duration is consistently excellent at 7.5 hours average with scores consistently in the 80s (76-83/100), providing crucial autonomic nervous system recovery time",
      "Resting heart rate remains well-controlled averaging 49 bpm with minimal daily variation (47-53 bpm), indicating good cardiovascular stability for POTS",
      "Activity levels are well-balanced averaging 6,068 steps with 14 workouts completed, showing you're maintaining fitness without overexertion"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep averages only 1.2 hours and shows inconsistency (0.9-1.8h), focus on sleep hygiene and earlier bedtime to improve restorative sleep phases",
      "HRV variability is concerning with a 26% fluctuation (50-63 ms), indicating autonomic instability - prioritize stress management and consistent sleep/wake times",
      "Sleep efficiency at 80.5% suggests frequent awakenings, consider reducing evening stimulants and optimizing bedroom temperature for deeper, more continuous sleep"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your controlled resting heart rate is excellent for POTS management, but the HRV fluctuations suggest your autonomic nervous system is still experiencing some instability. The consistent sleep scores are providing good foundational support for your condition.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Prioritize consistent bedtimes and wake times within 30 minutes daily to stabilize your circadian rhythm and reduce HRV variability, which is crucial for POTS symptom management"
