    "overall_assessment": "Your health metrics show strong consistency with solid sleep scores averaging 79.6/100 and good readiness at 80.8/100, which is excellent for POTS management. However, your HRV shows some volatility (ranging from 49-63 ms) and deep sleep could be optimized further for better autonomic recovery.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent sleep consistency with 7.5 hours average duration and strong efficiency at 80.5%, providing crucial autonomic stability for POTS",
      "Strong readiness scores averaging 80.8/100 with recent days showing 83-88, indicating good recovery capacity",
      "Maintaining active lifestyle with 15 workouts over 14 days and average activity score of 84.6/100, which helps with POTS symptom management through gradual conditioning"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep averaging only 1.2 hours is below optimal - aim for sleep hygiene improvements like cooler room temperature and consistent bedtime routine to boost restorative sleep phases",
      "HRV volatility (49-63 ms range in recent week) suggests autonomic stress - consider stress management techniques and monitor triggers that may correlate with lower HRV days",
      "Step count variability (3570-8639 steps) shows inconsistent activity patterns - aim for more consistent moderate daily movement to support POTS circulation without overexertion"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your resting heart rate of 49 bpm is excellent for POTS management, and the combination of good sleep scores with moderate HRV suggests your autonomic nervous system is responding well to current management strategies. The activity level appears well-balanced for gradual POTS conditioning without triggering flares.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Prioritize deep sleep optimization by maintaining a consistent bedtime routine and cooler sleep environment, aiming to increase your deep sleep from the current 1.0-1.8 hour range to consistently above 1.5 hours for better autonomic recovery."
