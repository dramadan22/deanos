    "overall_assessment": "Your metrics show strong performance with an excellent sleep score of 81.6/100 and high readiness at 83.0/100, indicating good recovery patterns. However, there's concerning variability in your HRV (ranging from 49-69 ms) and some inconsistent deep sleep patterns that warrant attention for POTS management.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent sleep duration averaging 7.5 hours with good efficiency at 82.4%, providing crucial autonomic nervous system recovery time needed for POTS",
      "Strong activity consistency with 16 workouts over 14 days and healthy daily step counts averaging 6,308, showing you're maintaining good movement without overexertion",
      "Your resting heart rate remains stable around 48.5 bpm average, which is excellent baseline cardiovascular fitness for managing POTS symptoms"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep is inconsistent, ranging from 0.9-1.3 hours (Jan 15th had only 0.9h vs 1.3h on Jan 13th) - aim for more consistent bedtime routines to stabilize this crucial recovery phase",
      "HRV shows significant day-to-day variability (49 ms on Jan 12th vs 69 ms on Jan 15th) - consider stress management techniques and consistent sleep timing to reduce this fluctuation",
      "Jan 13th shows a concerning pattern: shortest sleep (6.7h) paired with highest activity (93 score, 7,776 steps) and lower readiness (79) - prioritize sleep over high activity days"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "The HRV variability and inconsistent deep sleep patterns suggest your autonomic nervous system is experiencing some instability, which is critical to monitor with POTS. The stable low resting heart rate is encouraging and suggests your cardiovascular fitness is helping manage baseline POTS symptoms.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Establish a consistent bedtime routine to stabilize deep sleep duration above 1.1 hours nightly, as this will help reduce HRV variability and support better autonomic function for POTS management."
