    "overall_assessment": "Your health metrics show excellent overall performance with strong sleep scores (81.6/100) and readiness (84.9/100), though there's concerning variability in key autonomic markers. The dramatic HRV fluctuation from 75ms to 32ms on 2026-02-15 alongside elevated resting heart rate (51 bpm) suggests your nervous system experienced significant stress during this period.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Consistent sleep duration averaging 7.5 hours with good efficiency (85.5%), providing stable foundation for POTS management",
      "Strong deep sleep performance with 1.6 hours on multiple nights (2026-02-17, 2026-02-13, 2026-02-12), supporting autonomic recovery",
      "Excellent activity consistency with 21 workouts over 14 days and step counts ranging from 6,607-13,316, showing good tolerance for physical activity"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Address HRV volatility - the drop to 32ms on 2026-02-15 (compared to 75ms on 2026-02-14) indicates autonomic instability that needs investigation",
      "Prioritize sleep duration consistency - the 6.2-hour night on 2026-02-15 coincided with your worst HRV and readiness scores, suggesting shorter sleep significantly impacts recovery",
      "Monitor activity pacing around low HRV days - your 7,569 steps on 2026-02-15 may have been too much given the 32ms HRV reading"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your HRV averaging 63.2ms is generally good for POTS management, but the sharp drop to 32ms suggests your autonomic nervous system is highly sensitive to sleep deprivation and possibly overexertion. The correlation between your shortest sleep (6.2h) and worst autonomic markers indicates sleep consistency is critical for your POTS stability.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Establish a strict 7+ hour sleep schedule and use HRV as your daily activity guide - on days below 50ms HRV, reduce activity intensity and prioritize gentle movement and stress management."
