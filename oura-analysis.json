    "overall_assessment": "Your health metrics show solid performance with an excellent average readiness score of 84.1/100 and good sleep quality at 80.9/100. However, there's notable variability in your HRV (ranging from 50-72ms) and sleep duration (5.8-8.3 hours), which could be impacting your autonomic stability.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent activity consistency with 18 workouts over 14 days and strong activity scores averaging 87.8/100, showing good physical conditioning without overexertion",
      "Your resting heart rate is impressively low and stable, averaging 47.6 bpm with minimal day-to-day variation (45-51 bpm range)",
      "Strong readiness scores, particularly your three 90/100 days (Feb 5, Feb 1, Jan 30), indicating good recovery capacity"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Sleep duration consistency needs attention - you had a concerning 5.8-hour night on Jan 31 compared to 8.3-hour nights, aim for 7.5-8.5 hours nightly for better autonomic regulation",
      "Deep sleep is low at only 1.0 hour average with significant variation (0.7-1.5 hours), try establishing a stricter bedtime routine and cooler sleep environment",
      "HRV shows high volatility (50ms to 72ms swing), suggesting autonomic stress - consider stress management techniques and more consistent sleep timing"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your low, stable resting heart rate is excellent for POTS management, but the HRV variability and inconsistent sleep patterns could be triggering autonomic instability. The correlation between your best HRV days (72ms, 69ms) and longer sleep durations suggests prioritizing sleep consistency is crucial for your nervous system regulation.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Establish a consistent sleep schedule targeting 8+ hours nightly, going to bed and waking at the same time daily to stabilize your autonomic function and reduce HRV variability"
