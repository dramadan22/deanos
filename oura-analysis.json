    "overall_assessment": "Your health metrics show strong performance with an 81.4 sleep score and excellent readiness (81.8), indicating good recovery patterns. However, there's notable variability in your HRV (ranging from 49-66 ms in recent days) and some inconsistency in deep sleep duration, which are particularly important for POTS management.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent sleep duration averaging 7.6 hours, which is crucial for autonomic nervous system regulation with POTS",
      "Strong activity score of 86.3 with 18 workouts completed, showing you're maintaining good physical conditioning without overexertion",
      "Low and stable resting heart rate averaging 49 bpm, indicating good cardiovascular fitness despite POTS challenges"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep consistency needs attention - it varied from 1.0h to 1.7h recently, with January 13th showing only 6.7 total hours; aim for more consistent bedtime routines",
      "HRV shows significant daily swings (49-66 ms), suggesting autonomic stress; consider stress management techniques and consistent meal timing",
      "Sleep efficiency at 81.6% could be improved - focus on sleep hygiene practices to reduce nighttime awakenings that disrupt recovery"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your HRV variability and the correlation between lower deep sleep days (like Jan 13th at 1.3h) and reduced readiness scores (79) suggests your autonomic nervous system is sensitive to sleep disruption. The stable low resting heart rate is encouraging and indicates your POTS management strategies are working well.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Establish a consistent bedtime routine to improve deep sleep consistency, aiming for at least 1.2-1.5 hours nightly to support autonomic stability"
