    "overall_assessment": "Your metrics show strong performance with an excellent sleep score of 81.6/100 and solid readiness at 84.4/100, indicating good recovery capacity. Your HRV averaging 62.8 ms and relatively low resting heart rate of 47.6 bpm suggest your autonomic nervous system is responding well to your current routine.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent sleep consistency with 7+ hours nightly (7.3h average) and strong sleep scores, particularly Feb 20th at 87/100 with 1.7h deep sleep",
      "Strong HRV readings ranging 53-69 ms with your best day at 69 ms on Feb 21st, indicating good autonomic nervous system recovery",
      "Well-balanced activity levels averaging 8,092 steps with 22 workouts completed, showing you're maintaining fitness without overexertion"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep is inconsistent, ranging from 0.7h to 1.7h - aim for cooling your bedroom and avoiding screens 2 hours before bed to improve deep sleep consistency",
      "Sleep duration dropped below 7 hours on Feb 17th (6.8h) and Feb 18th (6.7h) coinciding with lower HRV (56, 53 ms) - prioritize 7.5+ hours nightly for better autonomic recovery",
      "HRV showed a concerning dip to 53 ms on Feb 18th when sleep was shortest - consider implementing stress management techniques like gentle yoga or meditation on lower sleep days"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your low resting heart rate (47.6 bpm average) combined with good HRV suggests your autonomic dysfunction is well-managed currently. The correlation between shorter sleep duration and lower HRV (Feb 18th) highlights how crucial consistent, adequate sleep is for your POTS symptom control.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Prioritize achieving 7.5+ hours of sleep nightly by setting a consistent bedtime routine, as your data shows HRV drops significantly when sleep falls below 7 hours, which directly impacts POTS management."
