    "overall_assessment": "Your health metrics show strong performance with an average sleep score of 81.3/100 and excellent readiness (84.9/100), indicating good recovery capacity. However, there's notable variability in your HRV readings (ranging from 50-76 ms over the past week) and some inconsistency in deep sleep duration that warrant attention for optimal POTS management.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent sleep efficiency at 83.6% with consistently good sleep scores, including a peak of 90/100 on Feb 3rd, supporting stable autonomic function",
      "Strong readiness scores averaging 84.9/100 with multiple days hitting 87-90, indicating your body is recovering well from daily stressors",
      "Impressive activity consistency with 16 workouts completed and maintaining an 85.5/100 average activity score while managing POTS"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep duration is quite low at only 1.0 hours average and highly variable (0.7-1.5h), aim for more consistent sleep timing and pre-sleep routine to support autonomic recovery",
      "HRV shows significant day-to-day fluctuations (50-76 ms), suggesting your autonomic nervous system may be responding to stressors - consider tracking triggers like hydration, meal timing, and stress levels",
      "Activity levels vary dramatically (4085-8366 steps), which can challenge POTS management - try to maintain more consistent daily movement patterns to support cardiovascular conditioning"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your relatively low resting heart rate (47.4 bpm average) combined with good HRV suggests your cardiovascular fitness is helping manage POTS symptoms. The variability in both HRV and activity levels indicates your autonomic system may benefit from more consistent daily routines.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Establish a consistent bedtime routine to improve deep sleep duration and reduce the HRV variability, as stable sleep patterns are crucial for autonomic nervous system regulation in POTS"
