However, there's significant variability in your HRV (ranging from 32-75 ms) and a concerning dip in readiness to 68 on Feb 15th that warrants attention.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent sleep consistency with 7.5 hours average duration and strong 85.8% efficiency, providing crucial autonomic nervous system recovery for POTS management",
      "Outstanding resting heart rate averaging 47.6 bpm, indicating good cardiovascular fitness which is beneficial for POTS symptom control",
      "High activity level with 19 workouts completed and 7,162 average daily steps, demonstrating good exercise tolerance despite POTS challenges"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Address HRV volatility - your HRV dropped dramatically to 32 ms on Feb 15th (vs 75 ms on Feb 14th), suggesting you need better stress management and recovery protocols",
      "Investigate the Feb 15th readiness crash to 68 combined with reduced sleep (6.2h) and low deep sleep (1.0h) - this pattern could trigger POTS symptom flares",
      "Optimize deep sleep consistency - while averaging 1.3h is decent, the range varies significantly (0.8h to 1.6h), and stable deep sleep is critical for autonomic regulation"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your data shows good POTS management overall with stable low resting HR and consistent sleep, but the dramatic HRV fluctuations and readiness drops suggest your autonomic nervous system is still experiencing stress responses that could impact orthostatic tolerance.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Monitor and address factors that caused the Feb 15th metrics crash - track hydration, salt intake, stress levels, and sleep environment to prevent similar autonomic dysregulation episodes"
