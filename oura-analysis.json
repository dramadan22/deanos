    "overall_assessment": "Your overall health metrics show solid consistency with an 80.1 sleep score and 79.9 readiness score over 14 days, indicating good baseline health management. However, there's concerning variability in your autonomic markers, particularly the dramatic dip on January 19th when your readiness dropped to 37 and resting heart rate spiked to 57 bpm.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Your average resting heart rate of 48.5 bpm is excellent for POTS management, showing good cardiovascular conditioning with most days (Jan 20-23) maintaining a stable 45-47 bpm range",
      "Sleep efficiency of 83.5% demonstrates you're getting quality rest when you do sleep, with your best nights (Jan 21-22) scoring 86-88 and providing 1.3-1.5 hours of deep sleep",
      "You're maintaining consistent activity levels with 11 workouts over 14 days and an average of 5,388 steps, showing good commitment to movement despite POTS challenges"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Deep sleep consistency needs attention - you had only 0.3 hours on Jan 19th compared to your 1.1-hour average, which directly correlates with your autonomic nervous system disruption that day",
      "HRV stability requires focus as it dropped to 43ms on Jan 19th (your lowest) when your readiness crashed, indicating autonomic stress that's particularly problematic for POTS management",
      "Sleep duration consistency could be optimized - ranging from 6.2 to 8.8 hours creates autonomic instability, aim for a narrower 7-8 hour window nightly"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "The January 19th data pattern (low HRV of 43ms, elevated RHR of 57 bpm, poor deep sleep of 0.3h, and crashed readiness of 37) suggests an autonomic flare that's classic for POTS episodes. Your recovery by January 21st shows your system can bounce back when you prioritize rest and maintain consistent sleep schedules.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Establish a consistent bedtime routine targeting 7-7.5 hours of sleep nightly to prevent the autonomic variability that triggered your January 19th crash, as sleep consistency is critical for POTS symptom management."
