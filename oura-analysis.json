    "overall_assessment": "Your health metrics show strong overall performance with above-average scores across all domains, but there are concerning patterns of sleep inconsistency that could impact POTS management. While your average HRV of 54.6 ms and readiness score of 83.2 indicate good recovery capacity, the significant sleep duration variability (ranging from 5.8 to 8.3 hours) needs attention for optimal autonomic function.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent activity consistency with 14 workouts completed and a high average activity score of 89.5/100, showing you're maintaining regular movement despite POTS challenges",
      "Strong HRV readings with your 14-day average of 54.6 ms and recent peaks of 69 ms (Jan 31) and 62 ms (Jan 30), indicating good autonomic nervous system resilience",
      "Impressive readiness scores averaging 83.2/100 with multiple days at 90/100 (Feb 1 and Jan 30), showing your body is generally recovering well between activities"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Stabilize sleep duration - you had a concerning 5.8-hour night on Jan 31 compared to 8.3 hours on Jan 27 and Feb 1; aim for consistent 7.5-8 hour windows to support autonomic regulation",
      "Address deep sleep deficiency with an average of only 1.1 hours and some nights as low as 0.3 hours (Jan 28); prioritize sleep hygiene and consider earlier bedtimes to increase deep sleep phases",
      "Monitor the relationship between low step days (2,785 on Jan 28, 3,110 on Jan 29) and corresponding lower readiness scores (78, 84) to find your optimal activity balance"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "Your HRV variability (ranging from 53-69 ms) and resting heart rate stability (45-51 bpm) suggest your autonomic nervous system is responding well to your current management approach. However, the sleep inconsistency pattern, particularly the dramatic drop to 5.8 hours on Jan 31, could trigger POTS symptom flares and should be your primary focus.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Establish a consistent sleep schedule by setting a fixed bedtime that allows for 8+ hours of sleep opportunity, as this will be most impactful for your POTS management and maintaining your currently strong HRV and readiness scores."
