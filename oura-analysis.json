    "overall_assessment": "Your data shows generally strong metrics with an 80.1 sleep score and healthy HRV of 54.3ms, but January 19th stands out as a significant outlier with poor readiness (37), elevated resting heart rate (57bpm), and minimal activity (725 steps). This pattern suggests your body experienced a notable stress event or flare that impacted your autonomic nervous system function.",
    "whats_going_well": [
      "Excellent sleep consistency with 4 out of 7 recent nights scoring 82-86, and strong deep sleep recovery on January 21st (1.5h) and 20th (1.6h) following the January 19th dip",
      "Your HRV shows good recovery capacity, bouncing back from the low of 43ms on January 19th to 54ms by January 18th, indicating resilient autonomic nervous system function",
      "Strong activity performance when feeling well, achieving 9,446 steps and 91 activity score on January 17th with excellent readiness (92) the following day"
    ],
    "areas_to_improve": [
      "Address the inconsistent deep sleep patterns - you ranged from only 0.3h on January 19th to 1.6h on January 20th, suggesting sleep architecture instability that can worsen POTS symptoms",
      "Investigate what triggered the January 19th crash (67 sleep score, 37 readiness, 57 RHR) to identify and avoid similar stressors that spike your heart rate and tank recovery",
      "Work on sleep duration consistency - the 6.2h night on January 18th followed by 8.8h on January 19th shows irregular patterns that can disrupt circadian rhythms crucial for POTS management"
    ],
    "pots_specific_insights": "The dramatic swings in your resting heart rate (45-57 bpm) and HRV (43-54ms) indicate your autonomic nervous system is reactive to stressors, which is typical for POTS. The fact that low activity days often coincide with elevated heart rates suggests your body is appropriately self-regulating to avoid overexertion.",
    "focus_for_next_week": "Prioritize consistent 7-8 hour sleep windows and identify what environmental, dietary, or activity factors preceded your January 19th autonomic crash to prevent similar episodes."
