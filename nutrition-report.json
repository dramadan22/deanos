    "strengths": [
      "Good variety of protein sources including salmon, chicken, and eggs supporting muscle preservation",
      "Inclusion of omega-3 rich salmon and anti-inflammatory foods like blueberries and seaweed",
      "Mix of whole foods with fiber sources from vegetables, fruits, and some whole grains"
    ],
    "gaps": [
      "Inconsistent meal timing with skipped breakfasts and entire missing days affecting metabolic health",
      "Limited colorful vegetables and polyphenol-rich foods - missing cruciferous vegetables, leafy greens, and diverse plant compounds",
      "Likely insufficient daily fiber intake (target 30g+) and missing key longevity nutrients like magnesium from nuts/seeds"
    ],
    "suggestions": [
      "Prep consistent breakfast options like overnight oats with berries, nuts, and protein powder to avoid skipping meals",
      "Add 2-3 cups of colorful vegetables daily through meal prep - roasted broccoli, spinach salads, and bell peppers for polyphenols"
